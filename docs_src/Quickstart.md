#  QuickStart

## Creating Robotic Workflows: ExpFlow
All robotic workflows are created from ExpFlow Robotic Workflows. [ExpFlow](https://d3tales.as.uky.edu/expflow/)
is a D3TaLES tool that allows researchers to systematically encode their
experimental procedures through an intuitive graphical interface. For more information see the 
[ExpFlow Documentation](https://d3tales.as.uky.edu/expflow/docs)

A user may create an ExpFlow Template, then use that template to generate an ExpFlow Robotic Workflow.
This Robotic Workflow can then be downloaded as a JSON file to the Robotics Workstation. (It is recommended that you 
store downloaded workflows in the `downloaded_wfs` folder.) A downloaded Robotic Workflow JSON file may be loaded 
and readied for robotic action through the `D3TaLES Robotics` app.

## Managing Robotic Workflows
The robotic workflows are managed via [FireWorks](https://materialsproject.github.io/fireworks/). If you are not 
familiar with Fireworks, it is highly recommended that you review the structure of FireWorks to 
better understand this system. Many operations to manage your robotic workflows can be implemented directily
via the FireWorks `lpad` and `rlaunch` commands. 

Additionally, the robotic system can be managed via the `D3TaLES Robotics` app.
This can be launched from the icon Robotics Workstation desktop page.  


## Running an Experiment...
Now it's time to run the robotic experiment! Be sure to follow the `Robot Run Checklist` whenever running the robot!

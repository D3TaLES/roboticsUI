"""
The snapshots directory contains Kinova snapshots for various locations on the robotics work table.
The snapshot naming is designed so that the robotics_api can access locations for vials and stations
easily. If anything on the robotics work table is moved, these snapshots must be adjusted. The easiest
way to adjust the snapshots is through the Kinova web UI. If the robot is on and connected to the
workstation, go to http://192.168.1.10/ to access the Kinova web UI.
